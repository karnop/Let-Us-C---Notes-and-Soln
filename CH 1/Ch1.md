# **Chapter 1**

C was designed and written by *Dennis Ritchie* in 1972. Even today, when it comes to speed and execution, nothing beats C.

> **Steps in learning C language :**   
(Alphabets, Digits, Special Symbols)   **->**  (Constants, Variables, Keywords)    **->**  (Instructions)  **->** (Program) 

The alphabets, digits and special symbols when properly combined form **Constants**, **Variables** and **Keywords**.  

> A **Constant** is an entity that doesn't Changes. Also called Literals.    
> A **Variable** is an entity that may Changes. Also called Identifiers.    
> A **Keyword** is a word that carries a special meaning. 32 keywords available in C.

## Constants
**Primary Constants :** Integer constants, Real Constants, Character Constants.     
**Secondary Constants :** Array, Pointer, Structure, Union, Enum, etc.      

> Rules for constructing integer constants:
1.  Must have atleast 1 digit.
2.  Must not have a decimal point.
3.  Can be positive or Negative.
4.  No commas or blanks allowed.
5. allowed range : -2^37 to 2^37 - 1    (for GCC Compiler)  
Ex : 426, -555


> Rules for constructing real constants:
1.  Must have atleast 1 digit.
2.  Must have a decimal point.
3.  Can be positive or Negative.
4.  No commas or blanks allowed.  
Ex : 325.54, -32,76

> Rules for constructing character constants:
1.  A single alphabet, a single digit or a single special symbol enclosed in single inverted commas pointing to left.   
ex : 'A', '='

## Variables

> Rules for constructing variable names : 
1. It is a combination of 1 to 31 alphabets, digits or underscores.   
2. First character in variable name must be alphabet or underscore.
3. No commas or blanks allowed.
4. No special symbols other than underscore allowed.
